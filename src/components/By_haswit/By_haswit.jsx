        Haswit - Handshake with IT sector is a platform which is the best way of stepping into IT field.
        It all started when we thought about the wrong thing going on society as we all are a middle class people cannot know how
        to become successful in life its not taught in schools colleges. Even then if know what to learn we cannot efford costs given by each
        platform to teach courses and stuff so we decided to launch a website which teaches every students software technologies at very cheap
        price with high quality of teaching thats haswit which has many features which are taught in Tech Innovation Drive and launching its first course as full 
        stack web development and Flutter app development.
